      "Transcription: Good morning everyone. Today let us learn about what is expert system? Expert system is a computer program that is designed to solve complex problems under private decision making ability. Like human expert, it performs this by extracting the knowledge from its knowledge base using reasoning and inference rules according to the user queries. The expert system is a part of a and the first expert system was developed in the year 1970, which is the first successful approach of artificial intelligence. It solves the most complex issues as an expert system by extracting the knowledge stored in the knowledge base. The system helps in decision making of complex problems using both facts and heuristics like human expert. It is called so because it contains the expert knowledge of a specific domain and can solve any complex problem of a particular domain, that of a particular domain. These system are designed for a specific domain, system, medicine, science, etcetera. The performance of the expert system is based on experts knowledge stored in the knowledge base and the more knowledge stored in the knowledge base and the more system improves the performance. The common examples of expert system suggestion of spelling errors while typing search Google box below is a block diagram representation of expert system. Below are some of the popular examples of expert system dental noise and Pexix and cadet characteristics of expert system high performance, understandable, reliable and high responsive components of expert system user interface, inference engine or knowledge base. Thank you.\n"
